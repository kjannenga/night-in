# night-in


In this project I used the The Movie Data Base API along with the Yelp API to display a nearby restaurant nearby that
                            delivers food and a random movie based on location and genre put into the form. On submit I used DOM Manipulation to
                            display the information to the user. I found the Yelp API difficult to work with because it needed a key and had CORS
                            issues, however solved this by routing the API call though CORS-Anywhere to allow my call to be processed. In V2 of this
                            application I would like to allow users to make accounts, save dates, and implement a feature that offers them to choose
                            movies or tv shows, and to cook or order in.
